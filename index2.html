                    Adventure Life is an adventure travel company offering private journeys, small group tours, and expedition voyages throughout the world. From their beginnings as a Latin America specialist in South America and Central America land tours, they have grown to now offer trips around the globe including less conventional destinations such as Africa, the Arctic, Antarctica and Alaska.

                    Their focus is nature, cultural, and active travel, and they apply ecotourism[1] principles to their tour and cruise programs. Most trips have a maximum group size of 12, yet typically run with 6 or fewer travelers. A large portion of travelers arrange customized or private itineraries. Since their founding in 1999, over 24,000 clients have traveled with the company.
                <br>
                    <br>Adventure Life was founded by Brian Morgan in 1999.[2] Morgan was working as a consultant in Quito for CARE in the late 1990s, but decided to return home to Montana. While applying for jobs in Montana, Morgan planned a group tour back to Ecuador and promoted it locally. This experience made him recognize that guided tours were a service in demand, and a niche industry that his own travel experiences and Ecuadorian connections had prepared him to explore further.[3]

                    Adventure Life launched in February 1999 with Spanish language study-trips, internships, and tours to Peru and Ecuador. Office was initially located in Havre, Montana, and Morgan hired the first staff member. During the first year of business, Adventure Life had fewer than 100 travelers.
